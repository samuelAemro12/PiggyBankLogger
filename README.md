# PiggyBank Logger

Minimal Expo + NativeWind starter for a simple personal finance tracker.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Run the app (clear Metro cache after config changes)

   npx expo start --clear

Notes

- Uses NativeWind for styling (Tailwind classes in React Native).
- Project UI uses ETB currency by default.
- App code lives in the `app/` directory; components are in `components/` and screens in `screens/`.

That's it â€” edit `app/index.tsx` (or files under `app/`) and reload the app on your device.
